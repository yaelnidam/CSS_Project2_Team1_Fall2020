It is possible that upstream social factors that vary by gender, such as diet or activity levels, impact rates of diabetes. Although we do not observe the rates of diabetes differentially for men and women (the only genders reported in the ACS), we can see if counties with a higher male to female ratio have higher or lower rates of diabetes. For this, we create a dummy variable indicating if a county has more or equal number of women than men (female_cnty). We then plot a box-and-whisker diagram of cases per 100 people for the two types of county.\n",
